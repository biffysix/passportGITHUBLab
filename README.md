# created a href link for Login with Github but in dark blue background so may not be able to see clearly
# I need to be logged off github for this to work for me.
# I click on the login with github link at /auth/login and can enter the GITHUB login site.
# I click on authorize to login BUT will run into an error
#  Something is wrong in this area where I uploaded the issue to Armaan on Slack
# I will upload again.
